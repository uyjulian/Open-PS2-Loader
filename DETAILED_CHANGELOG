rev966 - ElPatas1 - - SP193: Change in the PS2SDK about libpwroff. In one commit last year, i changed its design (along with AUDSRV) to use SIFRPC instead because of the change in design of the user SIFCMD buffer. Unfortunately, i didn't add proper re-initialization code to the new design of libpwroff. So when OPL starts the HDLDump server the old libpwroff SIFRPC server is contacted and the EE crashes. Server was broken in r878, and this change was made in 09-27-2016, working well again in r930. - Adjusted the HDLDump server thread priorities for proper functionality of the transfer data. - Tue Oct 25 02:47:13 2016 -0300

Native speakers can improve it) - Removed now-redundant GSM's Skip Videos sceMpegIsEnd related stuff (ontheflypatcher) - Since sceMpegIsEnd isn't GSM-dependant anymore - Wed Oct 19 08:53:05 2016 -0200
